Add collumn, row values toa hash. 

if exists then dont goto/create node. 
	this will prevent loops and if one exists it will stop the nodes from being created again....
	
	|||||o|||||
	||||oooo||| branch
->	||||o||o|||L then Right
	||||oooo||| goes through the right side(dead end)
	||||o||o|||	then the left node(arrow) which would then recreate nodes to the bottom right corner; -
	||||o||oo||	which means that more time would be wasted creating nodes that have already existed..
	|||o||||o||
	
	
	add row, col.... and add to hashmap, test to see if exist
		true
		{
			dont create that node, mark dead = true;
		}
		
		false
		{
			keep moving.
		}
